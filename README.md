*IMAGE OF WORKING APP = appInAction.png*

Morgoth's Market App:

This application uses mysql and node technologies to simulate a storefront displaying item name, department, available stock and price. The user can choose an item from the available inventory and specify how many of that item they would like. The app then responds with a confirmation of purchase. If the user attempts to purchase more than are available an error message will be shown.

This project could be used as a skeleton to set up a real storefront, or just as a fun pasttime.

All the user has to do is type "node market.js" in the terminal and hit "enter" and the application will start.

All user comments and questions about Morgoth's Market can be sent to isaac.jj2016@gmail.com

Morgoth's Market is maintained by Isaac Johnson.

*I got everything working except for the availability/instock functionality.
